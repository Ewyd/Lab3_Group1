# Cloud computing

This repository contains the files to reproduce the work done for the third lab for the Cloud Computing class with teacher Mrs Charlotte Laclau.

## Installation

Because the connection is done online, you don't need to install anything. Everything you need is the link with the password to access the client interface.

## Usage

Go to the following [IP address](https://54.147.121.206:8888/notebooks/Lab3/Demande_Client.ipynb) to start the process.
From here, you have to log in with the password sent by email. The goal is to avoid having a password in a repository GitHub.

You have now access to a Jupyter console. Follow the instructions and see the results.

## Code

The Python codes used to allow the <b>Usage</b> parts are:
  * [fonction_client.py](https://github.com/Ewyd/Lab3_Group1/blob/main/Fonction_Client.py) contains the necessary function to send a message that will be decrypted by the server.
  * [fonction_serveur.py](https://github.com/Ewyd/Lab3_Group1/blob/main/Fonction_Serveur.py) contains the code to execute the different calculation as well as the save of the log file.
  
## Demonstration

A demonstration of the process is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Awqo--g5095XmHAubJPlVRYdG5k5I187/view?usp=sharing), it can also be taken as a tutorial.
